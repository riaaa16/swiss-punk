## NEW WAVE DESIGN • SWISS PUNK TYPOGRAPHY

A one-page static website exploring the principles of New Wave typography in web design. Largely inspired by Wolfgang Weingart's works. Experiments with various font families, font sizes, letter spacing, halftone effects, and more. Predominantly raw HTML/CSS, with a small JS to adjust scroll position offsets.

### What you'll find

- `index.html` — the page markup.
- `global.css` — main stylesheet (variables, layout, responsive rules, halftone overlay, and small utilities).
- `scroll.js` — small runtime helper that intercepts anchor clicks and accounts for the dynamic sticky header height when scrolling.
- `public/images/` — image assets (hero, people, etc.).
