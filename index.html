                    New Wave design, also known as Swiss Punk
                    Typography, challenges the rules set by Swiss Style. The classic grid system
                    becomes a <mark>playground</mark> for expressive typography. As its name implies, Swiss Punk is
                    inspired by punk
                    subculture and postmodern language theory. <mark>Non-conformity</mark>—the idea that meaning is
                    created through
                    the reader's experience and the relationship between words—these sentiments mix together to create
                    the Swiss Punk style.

                    <br><br>
                    Some key points defining New Wave design are: moire patterns, varying font sizes
                    and font families, and skewed text. More recent forms of Swiss Punk typography incorporate bold
                    colors and collages.

                    Known as the father of New Wave, Wolfgang Weingart was born in 1941 in Southern
                    Germany. He studied
                    typesetting, linocutting, and woodcutting for two years before training as a
                    typesetter. In 1968, Weingart began teaching at the Schule für Gestaltung Basel in place of his
                    mentor, Emil Ruder. His style defied the idea that typography existed solely to convey
                    information.
                    As
                    they experimented with the spacing and positioning of letters, and new techniques were discovered,
                    the Swiss Punk Style was born.
                    <br><br>
                    Weingart later went on to teach and give lectures across the world, particularly in the United
                    States. He received several awards throughout his lifetime, such as the AIGA Medal. Weingart passed
                    in 2021.

                    Dan Friedman, born in 1945 in the United States, was a graphic and furniture designer.
                    He came to
                    learn Swiss Punk Typography when he studied underneath Weingart in the Schule für Gestaltung Basel.
                    In 1969, Friedman moved back to the United States and began work as an educator. He taught at
                    schools such as Yale University and served as the chairman of the design department for the State
                    University of New York at Purchase. During his time in New York City, he befriended many prolific
                    artists such as Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat.
                    <br><br>
                    Friedman died at the age of 49 in 1995, due
                    to AIDS. Before his passing, he designed posters for the Art for AIDS campaign as a form of
                    activism.

                    April Greiman is one of the first designers who embraced computer technology as a design tool. She
                    was born in 1948 in the United States and is credited for introducing the New Wave
                    design style from Europe to the United States. Like Friedman, she also learned from Weingart in the
                    Schule für
                    Europe to the United States. Like Friedman, she also learned from Weingart in the Schule für
                    Gestaltung Basel. After completing her studies in Switzerland, Greiman returned to America to work
                    as a freelance designer. She worked for several prestigious universities, such as the California
                    Institute of the Arts. Around this time, she began working with computers, video cameras, and other
                    new technologies as tools to further her art.
                    <br><br>
                    As of 2025, Greiman is still active, combining Swiss
                    Punk Typography with Postmodernism to create colorful works.

                Swiss Style formed in the <mark>1950’s to 1960’s</mark> under the influence of the International Typographic Style,
                the Bauhaus school, and more. The style focuses on minimalist graphics, grids, asymmetrical layouts, and
                sans-serif fonts—it is considered the base for graphic design today.
            </p>
            <p>
                In <mark>1964</mark>, Wolfgang Weingart joined the Schule für Gestaltung Basel and began teaching typography.
                Believing that he should teach a typography different from the Swiss Style, Weingart began experimenting
                with the base principles of the Swiss Style, such as the right angle.
            </p>
            <p>
                From <mark>1968 to 1974</mark>, Weingart used lead type and letterpress systems to create his typography. He
                experimented with varying font weights, letter spacings, and black and white contrasts as a way to
                visually divide text.
            </p>
            <p>
                By the <mark>mid-1970’s</mark>, Weingart became fascinated with offset printing and film systems. Inspired by the
                technique of layering film positives, Weingart layered collages with texts to create textures designs.
                Halftone dots and moiré patterns became a frequent feature in his works.
            </p>
            <p>
                His students Dan Friedman, April Greiman, and other artists, would later introduce New Wave design to
                countries outside of Europe. They combined New Wave typography with color and other decorative elements
                to create new and innovative pieces.
